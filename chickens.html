    <p> The <b>Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a <a href=""> domesticated junglefowl</a> species, with
        attributes of wild species such as the <a href=""> grey </a> and the <a href=""> Ceylon junglefowl </a>[1] that
        are originally from <a href="">Southeast Asia</a>. <b> Rooster </b>and <b> cock </b> are terms for adult male
        birds, and a younger male may be called a <b>cockerel</b>. A male that has been <a href=""> castrated </a> is a
        <a href=""> capon</a>. An adult female bird is called a <b>hen</b>, and a sexually immature female is called a
        <b>pullet</b>. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their <a href=""> meat
        </a> and <a href=""> eggs</a>) or as <a href=""> pets</a>. Traditionally they were also bred for
        <a href="">cockfighting</a> , which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are
        <a href=""> broilers </a> and for eggs are <a href=""> layers</a>.
    </p>
    <p> Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
        literature.</p>
    <p> Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
        Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
        subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt
        in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria
        and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from
        the 5th century BC.[7][8]</p>

    <!-- Terminology -->
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.[9][10]
        Other terms are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[11][12]</li>
        <li>Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]</li>
        <li>Chick: a young chicken[13]</li>
        <li>Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[14]</li>
        <li>Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[15]</li>
        <li>Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[16]</li>
        <li>Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
            immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[18]</li>
        <li>Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[19]</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Etymology -->
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century
        as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is widely used
        throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]</p>
    <!-- Etymology ends -->
    <!-- History -->
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (*manuk) is
        part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language (see Austronesian languages). Chickens, together with dogs
        and pigs, were the domestic animals of the Lapita culture,[26] the first Neolithic culture of Oceania.[27]</p>

    <!-- Biology -->
    <h2>Biology and habitat</h2>
    <p>Chickens are omnivores.[31] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even
        animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[32] or sometimes young mice.[33] The average chicken may live for
        5–10 years, depending on the breed.[34] The world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness
        World Records.[35]</p>

    <!-- behaviour -->
    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
    <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
        eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking order,
        with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from
        a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
        hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[citation needed]</p>
    <h4>Vocalizations</h4>
    <p>When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as
        well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their
        chicks and encourage them to eat.</p>
    <h4>Crowing</h4>
    <p>Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as
        well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.[citation
        needed]</p>
    <h4>Courtship</h4>
    <p>To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often lowering
        the wing which is closest to the hen.[45] The dance triggers a response in the hen[45] and when she responds to
        his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Male approaching the hen</li>
        <li>Male pre-copulatory waltzing</li>
        <li>Male waltzing</li>
        <li>Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate)</li>
        <li>Male mounting</li>
        <li>Male treading with both feet on hen's back</li>
        <li>Male tail bending (following successful copulation)[46]</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Nesting and laying behaviour</h4>
    <p>Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring
        nests into their own. The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations,
        rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same
        location. Two or more hens may try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small or one of the
        hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other. There is
        evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.[47]</p>
